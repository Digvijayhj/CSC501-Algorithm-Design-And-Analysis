# Empirical Analysis of Algorithms

## Project Overview

This project involves the empirical analysis of the Insertion Sort algorithm. The primary goal is to analyze the algorithm's performance, specifically the number of key comparisons and running time for sorting an array of orderable elements.

## Corrected Pseudocode for SortAnalysis

```python
def SortAnalysis(A):
# Input: An array A[0..n-1] of n orderable elements
# Output: The total number of key comparisons made
count = 0
n = len(A)
for i in range(1, n):
v = A[i]
j = i - 1
while j >= 0 and A[j] > v:
count += 1
A[j + 1] = A[j]
j -= 1
if j >= 0:
count += 1
A[j + 1] = v
return count
```

## Hypothesis about the Algorithmâ€™s Average-Case Efficiency

### Insertion Sort Algorithm

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. Although it is less efficient for large lists compared to more advanced algorithms like quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort, it has several advantages:
- Simple to implement
- Efficient for small data sets
- Stable (does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys)
- In-place (requires a constant amount of additional memory space)

### Estimation for a Randomly Generated Array of Size 10,000

To estimate the number of key comparisons and the running time for an array of size 10,000, we use the derived average-case formula:
